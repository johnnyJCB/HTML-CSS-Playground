            <h1>Assignment 5</h1>
            <div class="question">Question 1:</div>
            <p> 1. Examine the site map in Figure 2.32 . What type of site
                organization is used for the JavaJam website?
                Is it the most appropriate organization for the site? Why or
                why not?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The site map in Figure 2.32 illustrates a hierarchical site organization.<br>
                It provides a clear and structured way to organize content, making it easy for users to navigate through different
                     sections of the site.<br>
                I think this organization is appropriate as it allows users to quickly find the information they are seeking by just 
                    navigating through the different tabs.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="question">Question 2:</div>
            <p>2. Review the recommended web design practices from this
                chapter. Use the Web Design Best Practices Checklist
                (Table 5.1 ) to evaluate the JavaJam site that you
                created in earlier chapters. Cite three design practices
                that have been well implemented. Cite three design
                practices that could be implemented in a better way. How
                else would you improve the website?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>In my JavaJam site, I have a consistent site/header logo across all the views, starting from the home page, to the menu, and music page. 
                    I also made good use of basic design principles: repetition, contrast, proximity, and alignment by primarily using a CSS file for formatting.
                    <br>As far as navigation, the tab links are clearly and consistently labeled which makes it easy for the user to browse through. 
                    In regards to functionality, all the links work appropriately. <br>
                    Among the things that could be improved are adding information as to when was the time the page was last updated, making sure that the views on 
                    the webpage work well with mobile devices, and I could also add hyperlinks to downloads for media plug-ins.
